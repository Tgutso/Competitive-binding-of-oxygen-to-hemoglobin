# Cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin
Computational modeling by COPASI for cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin

>Welcome to "Cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin" repository, where you can acces to the modeled results by COPASI. COPASI is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using ODEs or Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events can be included in such simulations.
